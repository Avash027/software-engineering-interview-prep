    -- Requirements Definition
    -- Core requirements list
2. Design Evolution
    -- Atleast 3 diagrams which show the evolution of the design from a basic/core system to the end system 
    -- Each diagram has a description of which requirements are currently fulfilled by the architecture
    -- Every component in the design is described in the components section.
3. Tradeoffs
    -- Different approaches/solutions used in the design with their pros and cons
    -- Tradeoffs must be described in terms of system parameters like cost, ease-of-adoption, extensibility, etc...
    -- If a tradeoff is not an obvious choice, there must be capacity estimations to justify one approach over another
