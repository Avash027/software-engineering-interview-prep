## Colorful Cities

There are $N$ cities, numbered $1,2,â€¦,N$ and $N-1$ roads that connect these cities. You want to assign each city `1` or `0`. However, it is **not allowed** for two adjecent cities to be assigned `1`. Find the number of ways in which the cities can be assigned number modulo $10^9 + 7$.

There are **no loops**. There are **no multiple roads** between any two cities, and it is **always possible to travel from one city to another**.

### Constraints

$1 \leq N \leq 2*10^5$
$1 \leq a_i,b_i \leq N$

### Input

$N$
$a_1 \ \ b_1$
$a_2 \ \ b_2$
$\vdots$
$a_{N-1} \ \ b_{N-1}$

### Output

Print one integer, the number of ways in which the cities can be assigned number modulo $10^9 + 7$.

### Example

Input

```
3
1 2
2 3
```

Output

```
5
```

All the possible ways are listed below

$(1_0 , 2_0 , 3_0)$
$(1_1 , 2_0 , 3_0)$
$(1_0 , 2_1 , 3_0)$
$(1_0 , 2_0 , 3_1)$
$(1_1 , 2_0 , 3_1)$

### Test cases

**Edge cases**

```
1

Output: 2
```

```
2 1
1 2

Output: 3
```

```
4
1 2
1 3
1 4

Output: 9
```

### Hints

- Notice the number of edges. Is this a special type of graph?
- We don't want adjacent cities to be assigned `1`. So we only need to look at the adjacent cities when assigning number.
- For each city what all information should we store that can help us later?
- Let us consider a city $v_i$. If I give you the number of ways to assign `0` and `1` for each adjacent city of $v_i$ can you use it to find the answer for $v_i$?

### Editorial

**Prerequisites**

- DFS Traversal
- Basic Dynamic programming

**Optimal Solution $O(N)$**

Let us assume each city as a node and each road as an unweighted bidirectional edge. As there are only $N-1$ edges it is a tree.

For each node we want to store $2$ values, the number of ways it can be assigned $1$ and the number of ways it can be assigned $0$.

$dp[i][j]$ = number of ways to assign subtree of node $i$ by assigning $j$ to node $i$.

There are two cases

- First, let's have a look at the leaf nodes. There are only $2$ ways to assign number.
  **Recurrence relation**
  $dp[i][1] = dp[i][0] = 1$

<br/>

- For parent $v_i$ to be $1$ all its child $c_i$ should be $0$ (to fulfill the condition). We want to find **all possible ways**

  **Recurrence relation**
  $dp[i][1] = dp[c_1][0] * dp[c_2][0] * \dots * dp[c_k][0]$

<br />

- For parent $v_i$ to be $0$ all its child $c_i$ can be either $0$ or $1$.

  **Recurrence relation**
  $dp[i][j] = (dp[c_1][0] + dp[c_1][1])*(dp[c_2][0] + dp[c_2][1])* \dots * (dp[c_k][0] + dp[c_k][1])$

So we can calculate the values for child nodes and move to its parent nodes. This can be achieved in $O(N)$ using DFS.

**Time complexity :** $O(N)$
**Space complexity :** $O(N)$
